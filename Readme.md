Bank Transactions (C Project)

This is a simple terminal-based program in C to manage basic bank account operations using binary files. It's a menu-driven app that lets you add, update, delete, and view account details. All data is stored in a file called credit.dat, and there's an option to export account info to a readable text file.


What It Does

Add a new account with name and balance

Update the balance of an existing account

Delete an account

View all accounts in a formatted .txt file

Files in This Project

trans.c – main C file with all the logic

credit.dat – binary file where the accounts are stored

accounts.txt – generated file with all account info (good for printing)

trans.exe – compiled version for Windows

clients.dat – not currently used, might be leftover/test file

How to Compile and Run in GCC

To compile:

gcc trans.c -o trans.exe

To run:

./trans.exe

How to Compile and Run in clang

To compile:

clang transaction.c -o transaction

To run:

You’ll get a simple menu in the terminal where you can pick what you want to do.

FEW DETAILS

Account numbers go from 1 to 100

Each account has: account number, first name, last name, and balance

If you try to add an account that already exists, it won’t overwrite it

Deleted accounts are just cleared in the file

Works on Windows and Linux (tested with GCC and clang)
